## Using a Linter For a Consistent Coding Style

One improvement that would have been very useful throughout the entirety of the development process would've been using a linter to automatically check our code to help promote the coding standards and practices that we wanted to adhere to. A main issue throughout development was although we had agreed on a coding style for writing comments, function names, variables, and files, we would sometimes falter as a group and eventually branch off from the standards we set in favour of using a style or practice we were more comfortable with. Had we known we could use such a tool to help prevent the varying coding styles in the app, we would've made a bigger use out of it to help stay commited to a particular style.

Additionally, we believe we would've also benefited from the added bonuses of linters in terms of catching errors early on, or providing vulnerabilities in code to help make the implementing of logic and the subsequent testing of the process a simpler and quicker endeavor.

## Implementing a "Pre-merge Checklist"

An extremely beneficial practice that we should've set up before iteration 1 began was to write out a step-by-step guide on testing the validity of any sort of developer task, or feature being merged with the main branch. This would've helped take the load of other performing merge requests as often times we would find small bugs, edge cases, or logic decisions that required a second look at. The ideal checklist would've looked like:

* ***"Did you run the app using an existing user? A new user?"***
* ***"Did you thoroughly test all aspects of the task you're trying to complete?"***
* ***"Did you run the linter to validate the coding style, or help find any potential errors?"***
* ***"Did you try typing this, or did you try pressing this while missing that?"***

By setting up a reusable way of reminding ourselves of everything that our app should do prior to opening a merge request, it would've promoted greater consistency, accountability, and thoroughness throughout development, and we could have avoided many of the issues we encountered and maintained a higher standard of code quality throughout the project without wasting time on going back to fix smaller issues that we could've caught on the first go.

## Managing the Issues Board

One area for improvement would be the way we managed the GitLab issues board throughout each iteration. Although our initial approach wasn’t ineffective by any means, we’ve learned new strategies from both lecture suggestions, and developing a collaborative approach during iteration 3 when it came to time to plan its issue board. The new methods our group agreed on provided a simplier way of organizing tasks, prioritizing work, and tracking progress by way of agreeing to use a kind of transitive approach to working on developer tasks. 

Now as we worked on our individual tasks, we saw a large-scale growth in implementation and testing completion time by way of balancing how we planned on testing our implementations once a feature is done with the actual implementation details to mitigate the time spent picking up a testing ticket a while after the cooresponding feature was completed. Adopting these strategies sooner could have made the first few iterations more polished than they were initially as we wouldn't be jumping constantly between tasks, which resulted in pushing off the testing and test suite development related tasks.

## Productivity Syndrome

A more personable difference and one not every group member felt was that during certain iterations, some of the group felt as though compared to other iterations, that they weren't doing as much as they hoped or thought they should be compensating more to each iteration. Since thoughts like this are more personalized and internally contemplated, there is not a pre-defined fix that could've been considered to prevent this feeling of unproductivity, and instead we could've been more vocal both during and at the end of each iteration about concerns of individual achievement to help find ways to circumvent any doubts of completed tasks. While not determental to the end product of the application, it should've been more obvious to put more emphasis on communicating any concerning thoughts to help squash any feelings of self-doubt which would've made for a more enjoyable development cycle free from worry.
