# *"As a D&D player and a gamer, I want to have a simple, one-stop-shop app that makes it easy for me to find other players to connect with online.”*

I love to play Dungeons & Dragons (D&D for short), but finding people online to play with comes with its own sets of challenges that can sometimes make the process of finding people to play with difficult. These obstacles also persist for those in search of others to play video games with online (like Baldur’s Gate 3 & Fortnite). A common resource (especially for D&D players) is scrolling through posts on the [looking for games subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/) where people can share that they are looking for others to play with. There are also Discord servers for games, specifically for people to join and find others to play with. While these resources have been helpful in connecting gamers online, they are not a perfect solution. Campaign Finder is solely for online gamers that seek to play with others online. 

To expand a bit on the obstacles one faces (and thus why Campaign Finder is a needed product), let’s start with the biggest obstacle: time. It can be a challenge to find people online that are available the same times that you are to play. The aforementioned resources (Reddit, Discord) allow people to post the times they are looking to play, but it’s disorganized. If you are a person who can only play Monday evenings, you are going to have to scroll through the subreddit or do some searches online for posts by people who are also seeking to play Monday evenings. Suppose that you do find such a post – often when you do find it, you discover that 30+ other people have responded or the post was made 3 years ago, implying that the poster is no longer looking for someone to play with Monday evenings. So then you make your own post on these channels, sharing that you are looking to play D&D on Monday evenings. People start responding, which is great! You have overcome the time hurdle and found people that are available when you are! Let’s talk about the next obstacles you could face, sticking to the same example. 

You are a new player who loves high fantasy adventure games with an emphasis on role-playing characters. You don’t really care for guns and you don’t find difficult games fun. You’ve connected with a person who wants to play Monday evenings. Though, when chatting with said person, you discover that they are a D&D veteran who hates typical high-fantasy tropes, loves guns, and they want to play games with challenging dungeons and extremely difficult enemies. This is another obstacle: you have connected with someone who is available at the right times but the games you both want to play are extremely different. There are other obstacles not mentioned such as: some video games are not cross-platform, meaning that console gamers may need to find other players that overcome the same time hurdle, along with being able to play on the same platform. Lastly, to emphasize further why I seek a one-stop-shop app that will address these obstacles: when looking for others to play with online, there are so many resources recommended that it can be overwhelming, since the resources are not just specific to finding others to connect with. Roll20, Fantasy grounds, groups on social media sites such as Discord, Reddit, Facebook are not focused resources. Why can’t there be a go-to reliable app that is specific to this purpose? 

In the future the answers to [posts asking how to find others online](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/c3irwd/app_to_find_dnd_players_near_me/) can be simple: “If you are looking to find other gamers online, I would suggest Campaign Finder”, instead of “joining X discord server, checking out these websites, joining Facebook groups”, as the latter only re-routes the seeker to another site that still presents them with the previously mentioned obstacles.

Now that the reasons why Campaign Finder is needed are outlined, let’s drive the purpose of the application home: to streamline the process of finding online friends to play games with. The specific overall vision is to have an app where users can make an account, personalize their profile, allow them to specify the kinds of games they want to play, and when they want to play. Much like a dating app, it will then match users up with others with the same availability and interests. For example, the app will find people on my behalf who share availability on Monday evenings and have an interest in role-playing fantasy games. As a user, I can view the app’s suggestions, check out those people’s profiles, and send them a request to connect. Additionally, the ability to both create and join groups for gaming events, wherein hosts can invite their friends and/or seek out compatible matches for the event would be really useful in quickly connecting groups of players together. Such an app solves the time hurdle, the interests hurdle, and connects the user with others in real time. And it’s so simple! This is what makes Campaign Finder valuable.

To elaborate further, in order for Campaign Finder to be useful, it would need to allow users to do the following: 

* Easy-to-use account creation 
* Update and personalize their profile
* Search for others by name, time availability, and/or interests
* Match users instantaneously with other players that have similar interests and time availability
* Offer a safe space with the ability to block and report others
* Create game events that current friends and newly matched people can join
* Be able to connect with other players after being matched up

Campaign Finder will start out as a simple Android application. It is important to note that the primary (and currently, only) type of user for the app are those who seek to play games online with others.
Campaign Finder would be considered successful if it:
* Accumulates over 1000 users within the first month of launch
* Maintains over 100 new users daily after the first month
* The number of concurrent users increases by 10% each month

To summarize, Campaign Finder is a project dedicated solely to connecting gamers online; to make the process of finding people to play games with effortless.
