# *"What went right in the development process?‚Äù*

## Organization:

Throughout the iterations, all of our user stories and features that were to be completed during the iteration were broken down into multiple developer tasks each that were to be completed throughout the timeline of each iteration. The issues board on GitLab helped provide a centralized location for all tasks that needed to be done by the end of the iteration, and was split up in such a way that you could see the tasks everyone was working on and what was available.

At the beginning of iteration 1, Enoch took initiative in looking around issue board websites before ultimately landing on using GitLab's built-in version, and tailored it to have a simple and easy to follow developmental flow. Each iteration has a tab for the stories that are to be completed by the end of that specific iteration. The tab immediately following are for unassigned open developer tasks which stem from breaking each feaure into one or more smaller jobs that can be picked up by a team member. 

Thus, when beginning work, a team member could use the GitLab assign feature to assign themselves to that specific feature, moving that task from **"Open Tasks"** to an **"In Progress"** tab to organize the unassigned and assigned work. Once completed, a **"Code Review"** tab was specifically assigned to signal when a developer task is in the final stages of completion and require other team members to collaborate in determining whether it's completed.

Once finished, a **"Completed"** tab housed all the developer tasks completed so far, and contributes to our developmental goal by comparing the estimated time for completion assigned to that task initially, vs. the actual real time spent working through the task.

This organization helped keep a record of what was currently being worked on, who was working on what, and how close we are to achieving our goal. And it's crucial to commend **Enoch** and **Victoria** for the initial work spent on breaking those tasks up and getting ready before an iteration truly began.

## Communication:

Effective communication was undeniably important through the entirety of the project and our group saught communication through various means both inside and outside of alloted class time to bolster our developmental process.

Our **first** method of communication, and one we found ourselves using the most was a simple Telegram group chat, which let us maintain real-time communication between all group members, and helped us get a better understanding of where everyone was while working through development tasks. This made it easy to send notifications to everyone when a new branch was merged with the project which helped mitigate any future conflicts involving merging. It also helped in making plans for meeting up after or before class time, and as well as using any provided class time to work on the project.

The **second** method of communication for our group was to use any provided class time to work in-person on the project itself, or on building up developmental skills that we could use throughout our remaining tasks. This provided a way to hone the material learned and as a group apply it to a real world scenario by refactoring pre-existing code, or by writing and preparing for future iteration tasks such as system testing and preventing code smells and over-inheritance.

**Lastly**, only a few meetings were had throughout the entirety of the project which was mostly to help find a base on what worked for us as a group, and for an overall retrospective of how we felt the communication, collaboration and teamwork was, nearing the end of the projects life cycle. Initially, we thought about having weekly meetings as a checkin on what was completed and to showcase what we've achieved, but ultimately decided that a better use of our time was to be more loose with updates, and instead put the trust on all of us as team member who would know when to reach out for help or updates when required.

## Collaboration:

In order to achieve a better understanding of our project as a whole since work was split up, and it wasn't possible to have everyone working on the exact same thing all at once, we introduced the idea of having code reviews. 

Once a developer task was ready to be merged with the main branch, we encouraged as many of our team members as possible to open a merge request, pull it, and look around the branch as much as possible to see all the changes that were made, whether it was work done on the presentation, logic, or data layer.

This helped faciltate collaboration with other group members to get a sense of what they've accomplished during their task, and allowed for any concerns, comments, or questions to be raised at this time so that any changes could be made prior to the merge. Additionally, this also let group members who might've worked on other layers more extensively get a sense for what is happening on a layer they might not have worked on in some time.
